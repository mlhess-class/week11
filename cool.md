In a nutshell, U of M is a magical place where the phrase "Go Blue" echoes louder than any sound, where squirrels are the local celebrities, and where winters are colder than a penguin's picnic, and we wouldn't have it any other way. So, if you're into fountain traditions, random "It's Great to be a Michigan Wolverine" chants, and singing ‘Hail to the Victors’ at the top of your lungs, then congrats, you’re officially Michigan material!
